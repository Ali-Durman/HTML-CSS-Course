<!DOCTYPE html> means its latest version of html

Nesting = element inside an element

<html> = a web page

<head> = nonvisible elements like <style>, <title>, <link>

<link> element is special element its void elements = don't have closing tag and its takes two attributes one is rel stans for relation and href and its means what file we're going to link into this file

<body> = contains all element that are visible
